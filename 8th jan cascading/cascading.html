Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods
 include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however
 learners can also educate themselves.[1] Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the
 way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. </p>
