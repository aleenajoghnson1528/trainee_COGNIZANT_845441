<h2>Demonstrating the Box Model</h2> 

<p>The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: borders, padding, margins, and the actual content.</p>

<div>In web development, the CSS box model refers to how HTML elements are modeled in browser engines and how dimension of those HTML elements 
are derived from CSS properties. It is a fundamental concept for the composition of HTML webpages.[1] The guidelines of the box model are described 
by web standards World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifically the CSS Working Group. For much of late-1990s and early 2000s there had been 
non-standard compliant implementations of the box model in the mainstream browsers. With the advent of CSS2, which introduced the box-sizing 
property, the problem had mostly been resolved.</div>
