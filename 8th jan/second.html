The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit, also called a pineapple, and the most economically significant plant in the
 family Bromeliaceae. The pineapple is indigenous to South America where it has been cultivated for many centuries. The introduction of the pineapple
 cultivation to Europe in the 17C made it a significant cultural icon of luxury. Since the 1820s pineapple has been commercially grown in greenhouses and
 many troplcal plantations and it is the third most important tropical fruit in world production. In the 20C, Hawaii was a dominant producer of pineapples, 
especially for the US, but in 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, and the Philippines accounted for nearly one-third of the world's production of pineapples.
